## Introduction

XO Game is a web-based implementation of the popular game Tic-Tac-Toe, where two players take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols ('X' and 'O'). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If no player achieves this and all cells are filled, the game results in a tie.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and includes a simple user interface for an enjoyable gaming experience. You can also keep track of your wins and ties as you play!
